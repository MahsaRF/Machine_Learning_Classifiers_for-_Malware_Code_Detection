# Machine_Learning_Classifiers_for-_Malware_Code_Detection
Comparison of Machine Learning classifiers for malware code detection, 2017


•	Designed and trained a machine Learning-based malware code detection model using a multitude (44) of run-time hardware performance counters (HPC) as features to capture execution patterns that scale a wide range of benign and malicious applications (200 benign applications and more than 400 malware applications). By defining the malware detection as a binary classification problem, different supervised learning algorithms were applied using WEKA tool

•	Utilized Linux profiler tool PERF for collecting HPC values while applications are getting executed in CPU

•	Thoroughly analyzed various type of machine learning classifiers such as regressions, decision trees, SVM and neural networks

•	Overall Random Forest has shown the best performance (87%-95%) in terms of True Positive rate and accuracy for all the malware classes except worms. We have observed weaker performance for worms implementing ensemble voting as compared to other classes of malware
